# Unit Converter (PyQt5 Application)



## Overview

This is a PyQt5-based desktop application for converting units across various categories like **Length**, **Weight**, **Temperature**, and **Volume**. The application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, including a Windows toolbar icon, functional "Copy" buttons with icons, and a clean, fixed window size layout for consistent use. Itâ€™s ideal for users who need a simple and effective unit converter.

## Features

- **Unit Conversion**: Convert between multiple units in categories like Length, Weight, Temperature, and Volume.
- **Copy Functionality**: Copy input and output values to the clipboard using copy buttons with icons.
- **Fixed Window Size**: Ensures the layout remains consistent, with no resizing allowed.
- **Windows Toolbar Icon**: Displays a custom icon on the toolbar and title bar.
- **Stylish Interface**: Clean design with rounded input fields, well-structured layout, and hover effects on buttons.
